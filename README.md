# relyzer.github.io

A simple, first iteration of my personal website!  
This project also serves as a training ground for my front-end skills and clean coding.  
As my skills improve, I hope to add more cool features to my site, so stay tuned!  

## To do:

1.) Further improve aesthetics and responsive design! Add more interactive / dynamic elements!  
2.) Make it even prettier!   
3.) Separate the data into another folder/fileset from the components (SOC principle)  
4.) Add pagination to project section (also consider the necessity and the benefit for UX) or a hover animation  
5.) Add a website loading animation upon first entry  
6.) Properly utilise Next.js static props function  

## Website initially started from:

A TypeScript Next.js example  
By executing [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript&project-name=with-typescript&repository-name=with-typescript)

## Make sure to install all dependencies and TypeScript!

```bash
npm install
```

## To run the development server

```bash

```
