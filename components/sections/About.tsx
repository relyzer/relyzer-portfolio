          Hey there, thanks for taking the time to look at my website!
        </h3>
        <p className="px-4 pb-4">
          I am <strong>Kevin</strong>, and I enjoy the feeling of designing and
          creating my very own digital products. <br /> <br />
          I have been interested in tech since young. <br /> <br />
          From figuring out how to install and play StarCraft 1 at 3 years old,
          to adding widgets and simple scripts to my blogspot site in my youth.{" "}
          <br />
          As a mechanical engineering student back in 2013, I was intrigued with
          the idea of developing my own iOS mobile app and being able to call it
          my creation. <br />
          The ability to create a functioning product with a computer,
          fascinates me more so than mechanical engineering, which requires
          physical components to assemble a prototype. It feels like wielding
          magic!
          <br />
          That was how my true journey into tech began - by installing Xcode and
          tinkering with iOS programming. It eventually led to my decision to
          enroll for a tech degree out of passion, while serving the military.
          <br />
          Now equipped with a formal education in tech and some professional
          backend development, coupled with strong design skills and an
          analytical mindset, I became more confident (and competent) in
          creating amazing products.
          <br />
