          Hey there, thanks for taking the time to look at my website!
          <br />
          My name is <strong>Kevin</strong>, and I enjoy designing and creating
          digital products.
          <br />
          Since young, I have been interested in tech.
          From figuring out how to install and play StarCraft 1 at 3 years old,
          to adding widgets and simple scripts for my blogspot site at 13 years
          old
          <br />
          <br />
          My first foray into programming began in 2013 while I was a mechanical
          engineering student. <br />
          With intentions to create an iOS mobile application, I downloaded
          Xcode and attempted to learn iOS programming. <br />
          Having discovered that passion, I made the decision during my military
          service to enroll for a tech degree in university.
          <br />
